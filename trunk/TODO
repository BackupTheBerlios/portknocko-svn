- For Fender. Support for IPV6.
- For Lucho. --strict behavior should be set by default.
- For Fender. Possible memory fragmentation when receiving a DoS attack. Slab allocation 
solves the problem of internal memory fragmentation.
- To check:
	* rcu (for locking linked lists and avoid large blocks of spinlocks)
	* tfm per CPU
	* config... check if the netlink extension is available at compilation time
