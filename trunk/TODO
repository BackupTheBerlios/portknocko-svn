TODO:
-----

- For Fender. Support for x_tables and IPV6.
- For Lucho. --strict behavior should be set by default.
- For Fender. Possible DoS attack with the traditional port knocking mode.
- For Fender. Possible memory fragmentation when receiving a DoS attack.

DONE:
-----

- By Fender. Memory leak fixed in has_secret() function.
- By Fender. Input parameters validation at user and kernel space.
- By Lucho. SHA256 by default.
- By Fender. Kernel panic fixed.
- By Lucho. Close knock done.
- By Lucho. One knock per IP per minute.
- By Fender. parse() from libipt_pknock.c done.
- By Fender & Lucho. 2 rules to allow knocks in UDP and traffic in TCP for instance.

- By Fender. New parameter 'gc_expir_time' to set the expiration time of the garbage collector.
- By Lucho. Userspace msg as a struct containing rule_name and peer_ip
