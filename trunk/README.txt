INSTALLATION
------------

cd portknocko

cd iptables
make clean
make
make install
cd ..

cd kernel
make clean
make
make install

depmod -Ae

note: if you use: "insmod ./ipt_pknock.ko", first you should do "modprobe cn" to load the netlink connector.


USAGE:
------

We will show you some different possibilites on how to use this module:

1) "the simplest way", one rule portknocking:

$ iptables -P INPUT DROP
$ iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m pknock --name SSH --knockports 2000,2001 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

$ telnet yourserver 2000 # first knock
$ telnet yourserver 2001 # last knock

$ ssh user@yourserver

all knocks and traffic must be TCP packets.

options:
--------

[--time] 	-> max time between knocks.
[--strict] 	-> if the peer fails one knock during the sequence, must start over.	


2) "the crypt way", hmac auth with two rules:

$ iptables -P INPUT DROP
$ iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m pknock --name SSH --knockports 2000,2001 --secure your_secret -p udp -j DROP
$ iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m pknock --name SSH --checkip -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

this way you must send each UDP knock packet with a payload containing a md5 hmac digest:

	md5_hmac(your_secret, your_ip, epoch_min)

note: "epoch_min" is the UTC min since January 1st 1970 (unix time), so you must keep you hardware clock sync. You can do it this way:
	
$ rdate ntp.server # this will set your system clock
$ /sbin/hwclock --systohc --utc # this will set your hardware clock to UTC

after the sequence is complete, you can begin the TCP traffic through port 22.

We provide you a client for knocking the crypt way:

$ cd test
$ util/knock.sh <IP src> <PORT dst> <secret>

e.g: util/knock.sh 127.0.0.1 2000 your_secret


COMUNICATION WITH THE USERSPACE:
--------------------------------

In other port knocking implementations, there is a server that periodically looks up the firewall logs for a correct sequence of port knocks. When it is found, the server usually set a new iptable rule. 

A great possibility would be if the server just listens and receives a msg when something interesting happens. If this would be possible, surely it must simplify the architecture of the server and make it more efficient.

Thanks to netlink sockets, a message from this kernel module is sent to the userspace each time a peer match a knock sequence.
So for example you could have a server listening in the userspace and when someone matches the sequence, the server receives a msg allowing you to do whatever you want. e.g: you could start a webserver, add the peer to a whilelist, etc. everything in a smooth and efficient way.

step by step:

1) edit ipt_pknock.h and set #define NETLINK_MSG 1
2) compile and load the module
3) load the server. There is a minimal userspace implementation in experiments/netlink_broadcast that prints a msg each time someone matches the sequence.


TESTS: (be careful, it will erase your loaded iptables rules)
------

* if you are a developer you want to run these while you refactor the code *

cd test/
./testrunner.sh all.test

note: we use a modified hping version that does not wait 1 sec for each sent packet as the original version, so tests can run much faster.
