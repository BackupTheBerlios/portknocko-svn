shax-py 0.92
============
This is a collection of Python modules that implement
the NIST's draft SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 standards.
The interface is the same as the sha module. SWIG
interface files (.i) are included but are not used due to
broken distutils support.

To build:

> python setup.py build

To install:

> python setup.py install
