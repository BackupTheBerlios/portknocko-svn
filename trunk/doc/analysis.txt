simple analysis of pknock rules
===============================

tables:
	filter
	nat
	mangle

chains for filter:
	INPUT
	OUTPUT
	FORWARD

A Packet Traversing the Netfilter System:

   --->[1]--->[ROUTE]--->[3]--->[4]--->
                 |            ^
                 |            |
                 |         [ROUTE]
                 v            |
                [2]          [5]
                 |            ^
                 |            |
                 v            |

In PortKnocking we will consider the 'filter' table, and the hooks [2], [3] and [4] which are 
involved in 'filtering'.

So for example we could try:

(1) iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m pknock --knockports 2005,2000,3002 --name TEST --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

(1) The pknock module is not going to match the rule (match() return 1) until you are in the ALLOWED 
status. To achive this, you must first send three packets to these ports in this order: 2005, 2000 
and 3002. From this moment you match the pknock rule and all the following packets sent from you to 
port 22 are going to apply the target ACCEPT.
