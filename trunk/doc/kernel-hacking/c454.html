>&#13;   In order to get your stuff into shape for official inclusion, or
   even to make a neat patch, there's administrative work to be
   done:
  </P

>&#13;     Figure out whose pond you've been pissing in.  Look at the top of
     the source files, inside the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>MAINTAINERS</TT
>
     file, and last of all in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>CREDITS</TT
> file.
     You should coordinate with this person to make sure you're not
     duplicating effort, or trying something that's already been
     rejected.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Make sure you put your name and EMail address at the top of
     any files you create or mangle significantly.  This is the
     first place people will look when they find a bug, or when
     <SPAN

><P
>&#13;     Usually you want a configuration option for your kernel hack.
     Edit <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Kconfig</TT
> in the appropriate directory.
     The Config language is simple to use by cut and paste, and there's
     complete documentation in
     <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     You may well want to make your CONFIG option only visible if
     <CODE
CLASS="symbol"
>CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL</CODE
> is enabled: this serves as a
     warning to users.  There many other fancy things you can do: see
     the various <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Kconfig</TT
> files for ideas.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     In your description of the option, make sure you address both the
     expert user and the user who knows nothing about your feature.  Mention
     incompatibilities and issues here.  <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
> Definitely
     </I

> end your description with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

     idea what you are talking about.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;     Edit the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Makefile</TT
>: the CONFIG variables are
     exported here so you can usually just add a "obj-$(CONFIG_xxx) +=
     xxx.o" line.  The syntax is documented in
     <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt</TT
>.
    </P

><LI
><P
>&#13;     Put yourself in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>CREDITS</TT
> if you've done
     something noteworthy, usually beyond a single file (your name
     should be at the top of the source files anyway).
     <TT
CLASS="filename"
>MAINTAINERS</TT
> means you want to be consulted
     when changes are made to a subsystem, and hear about bugs; it
     implies a more-than-passing commitment to some part of the code.
